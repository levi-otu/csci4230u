When designing frontend interfaces the following rules must be met.

- All shared components must be located in the global/components directory.
- The default colour scheme of the application will be dark mode. The secondary colour for highlights will be amber.
- Shadcn will be the primary UI framework for all components.
- DO NOT use native HTML elements unless absolutely necessary. All elements should be defined as components through Shadcn or the custom component library.
